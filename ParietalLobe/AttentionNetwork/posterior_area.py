Neurological Function:
    Posterior Attention Network (Parietal):
    - Spatial attention
    - Attention shifting
    - Visual attention control
    - Location-based attention
    - Feature-based selection
    - Attentional priority mapping
    - Spatial working memory

Potential Project Implementation:
    Could handle:
    - Attention focus control
    - Priority mapping
    - Spatial attention allocation
    - Feature selection
