"""
Neurological Function:
    V1 (Primary Visual Cortex) is the first stage of cortical visual processing.
    It contains:
    - Simple cells that respond to oriented edges
    - Complex cells that detect movement direction
    - Retinotopic mapping (spatial organization matching retina)
    - Basic feature detection (edges, contrasts, spatial frequencies)
    
Potential Project Implementation:
    Could handle:
    - Basic image preprocessing
    - Edge detection
    - Initial feature extraction
    - Visual signal filtering

# Implementation will be added when needed
