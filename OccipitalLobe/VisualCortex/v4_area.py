Neurological Function:
    V4 specializes in color processing and intermediate feature recognition:
    - Color constancy processing
    - Complex shape processing
    - Feature conjunction analysis
    - Attention modulation
    - Object recognition contributions

Potential Project Implementation:
    Could handle:
    - Color analysis and correction
    - Complex feature detection
    - Pattern matching
    - Attention-based filtering
