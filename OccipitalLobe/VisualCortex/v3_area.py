"""
Neurological Function:
    V3 processes form and motion:
    - Integrates local motion signals
    - Processes dynamic form information
    - Contributes to depth perception
    - Handles global motion patterns
    - Orientation-selective processing

Potential Project Implementation:
    Could handle:
    - Motion detection algorithms
    - 3D structure analysis
    - Dynamic form processing
    - Depth mapping
