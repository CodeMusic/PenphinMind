Neurological Function:
    V5/MT (Middle Temporal) specializes in motion processing:
    - Direction-selective responses
    - Speed processing
    - Motion integration
    - Depth from motion
    - Global motion patterns

Potential Project Implementation:
    Could handle:
    - Motion tracking
    - Speed calculation
    - Optical flow analysis
    - Movement prediction
