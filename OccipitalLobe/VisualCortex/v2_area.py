Neurological Function:
    V2 (Secondary Visual Cortex) processes more complex visual features:
    - Combines signals from V1
    - Processes contours and shapes
    - Handles figure-ground separation
    - Processes illusory contours
    - Involved in visual attention

Potential Project Implementation:
    Could handle:
    - Object boundary detection
    - Shape analysis
    - Visual pattern recognition
    - Figure-ground segmentation

# Implementation will be added when needed
