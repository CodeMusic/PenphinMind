Neurological Function:
    Subthalamic Nucleus provides motor control:
    - Response inhibition
    - Motor program selection
    - Impulse control
    - Action cancellation
    - Movement modulation
    - Behavioral stopping

Potential Project Implementation:
    Could handle:
    - Response inhibition
    - Action cancellation
    - Motor modulation
    - Behavior control
