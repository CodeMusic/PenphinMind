Neurological Function:
    Hippocampus manages memory formation and spatial processing:
    - Short-term to long-term memory conversion
    - Spatial navigation and mapping
    - Pattern separation and completion
    - Episodic memory formation
    - Contextual learning

Potential Project Implementation:
    Could handle:
    - Memory storage/retrieval
    - Spatial mapping
    - Context management
    - Pattern recognition
