Neurological Function:
    Sensory Relay Nuclei of Thalamus act as gateway for sensory information:
    - Filters incoming sensory signals
    - Routes information to appropriate cortical areas
    - Modulates attention and arousal
    - Coordinates sensory integration
    - Gates information flow based on relevance
    - Maintains sensory maps

Potential Project Implementation:
    Could handle:
    - Input routing and filtering
    - Signal priority management
    - Cross-modal coordination
    - Attention-based filtering
