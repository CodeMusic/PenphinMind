"""
Neurological Function:
    Thalamic Reticular Nucleus acts as attention gateway:
    - Controls thalamic sensory gating
    - Manages attention switching
    - Filters irrelevant information
    - Coordinates sleep-wake transitions
    - Modulates arousal states
    - Enhances relevant signals

Potential Project Implementation:
    Could handle:
    - Attention management
    - Signal prioritization
    - State transitions
    - Information gating
