Neurological Function:
    Motor Coordination in Cerebellum handles movement precision:
    - Fine-tunes motor movements
    - Maintains balance and posture
    - Coordinates timing of actions
    - Error correction in movements
    - Adapts motor programs
    - Learns movement sequences

Potential Project Implementation:
    Could handle:
    - Movement optimization
    - Timing control
    - Error detection/correction
    - Motion smoothing
