Neurological Function:
    Heschl's Gyrus contains the primary auditory cortex (A1) and is the first
    cortical structure to process auditory information. It processes basic
    acoustic features including:
    - Frequency discrimination
    - Sound intensity
    - Temporal resolution
    - Pitch processing

Project Function:
    Primary acoustic signal processing including:
    - Frequency analysis
    - Amplitude processing
    - Temporal feature extraction
    - Basic pitch detection
