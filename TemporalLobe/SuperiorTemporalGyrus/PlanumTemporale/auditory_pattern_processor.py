Neurological Function:
    The Planum Temporale, located in the superior temporal gyrus posterior to 
    Heschl's gyrus, is crucial for:
    - Processing complex sound patterns
    - Speech sound analysis
    - Musical pattern processing
    - Phonological working memory
    It shows marked left-hemisphere asymmetry in most humans.

Project Function:
    Processes complex auditory patterns including:
    - Speech rhythm analysis
    - Prosodic feature extraction
    - Musical sequence processing
    - Temporal pattern recognition
