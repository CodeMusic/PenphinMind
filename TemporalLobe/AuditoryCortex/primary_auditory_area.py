"""
Neurological Function:
    The primary auditory area (A1) processes basic characteristics of sound including 
    frequency, intensity, and temporal patterns. It's the first cortical structure 
    to process auditory information.

Project Function:
    Handles core audio processing including:
    - Raw audio input/output management
    - Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
    - Audio stream processing
    - Volume control and device management
