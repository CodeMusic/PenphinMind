Neurological Function:
    The auditory belt area surrounds the primary auditory cortex and processes 
    spatial aspects of sound, including sound localization and motion detection
    in auditory space.

Project Function:
    Handles spatial audio processing including:
    - Sound source localization
    - Spatial audio rendering
    - Motion tracking through audio
    - 3D audio processing
