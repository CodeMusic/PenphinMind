Neurological Function:
    The secondary auditory area (A2) processes more complex sound patterns,
    including harmony, melody, and environmental sounds. It's involved in 
    auditory scene analysis and pattern recognition.

Project Function:
    Handles advanced audio processing including:
    - Audio pattern recognition
    - Complex audio feature extraction
    - Audio scene analysis
    - Sound classification
