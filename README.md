# PenphinMind

An AI the follows the structure of the mind and brain. It has a bicameral mind, where unique agents engage in perspective thinking.
This project is based on the CodeMusai work which evolved into RoverByte. The codename for this project is Penphin, it is a mix of the words penguin and dolphin.
I associate the spirit animal of a penguin to my creative side, and a dolphin for my logical side. Since this project follows this bicameral approach, the project became Penphin!

A modular operating system for AI-powered audio interaction, built with a neural architecture inspired by the human brain.

## Features

- Speech recognition and synthesis
- Neural command processing
- Modular architecture
- Real-time audio processing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PenphinOS.git
cd PenphinOS
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash

```

4. Configure your environment:
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Add your API keys for OpenAI and ElevenLabs

## Usage

Run the system:
```bash
python runPenphinOS.py
```
