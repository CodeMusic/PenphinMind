Neurological Function:
    Vestibulocerebellum manages balance and spatial orientation:
    - Balance maintenance
    - Eye movement control
    - Spatial orientation
    - Motion processing
    - Posture adjustment
    - Equilibrium control

Potential Project Implementation:
    Could handle:
    - Balance algorithms
    - Spatial orientation
    - Motion compensation
    - Stability control
